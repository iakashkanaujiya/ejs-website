    "productDescription": "Lotus Pink Absolute Oil, Nelumbo nucifera, has been credited with numerous beneficial properties both physical and spiritual. The Ancient Romans and Greeks used it to cure ailments such as asthma, rheumatism and internal problems. Its purported healing powers have extended to epilepsy, jaundice, kidney and bladder complaints and even the plague. It has also been used as an aphrodisiac and to guard against witchcraft. It is now believed to be a good source of beneficial negative ions when worn close to or on the skin. Pink Lotus Absolute is extracted from the blossoms of the pink variety of Nelumbo nucifera which grows extensively in ponds of South India. It is a dark orange viscous liquid which can also be soft waxy in consistency. Like white lotus it can also display significant odor differences depending on the location of the ponds, the weather, etc. It is not grown under cultivation but appears in ponds over a wide area in Tamil Nadu.",
